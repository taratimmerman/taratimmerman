I recently graduated from Lambda School in Full Stack Web Development and enjoy creating inclusive, user-friendly and efficient web applications. I thrive in a collaborative environment and appreciate building excellent relationships between people and teams. When I am not programming, I can be found longboarding and spending time with my wife and pups in Silicon Slopes‚õ∞Ô∏è.
